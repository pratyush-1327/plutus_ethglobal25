# Flutter Environment Configuration

This file should be created when you want to use environment variables for your Flutter app.

## Using Environment Variables

### Method 1: --dart-define (Recommended for Development)
```bash
flutter run -d web --dart-define=INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_actual_project_id_here
```

### Method 2: System Environment Variables
#### Windows:
```cmd
set INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_actual_project_id_here
flutter run -d web
```

#### Linux/Mac:
```bash
export INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_actual_project_id_here
flutter run -d web
```

### Method 3: Create .env file (Optional - requires additional packages)
If you want to use a .env file, you would need to add packages like `flutter_dotenv` to your pubspec.yaml.

## Required Environment Variables

- `INFURA_PROJECT_ID`: Your Infura project ID for Ethereum RPC access
- `BACKEND_BASE_URL`: URL of your backend API (defaults to http://localhost:8000)
- `DEBUG_MODE`: Set to 'true' for debug mode (defaults to false)

2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new project
4. Copy the Project ID from your dashboard
